Although size normally also determines complexity, due to segregation of duties, company structure or as legacy or organic growth, some small business have rather complex file storage and access requirements. Migrating files and document storage from an in-house system to the cloud, will not only increase reliability, scalability, security and useability, it can also provide an opportunity for business to review their filing structure and simplify how and where their files and documents are stored."

Users didn't like to work from home because accessing files, required the use of the company VPN which at the time was cumbersome and slow."

The result was that users could now securely access company files conveniently from any computer with an internet connection, allowing users to work from home (in time for COVID lockdown) and room for future data growth."
